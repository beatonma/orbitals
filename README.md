# Orbitals

Orbitals is an interactive N-body gravity simulator. It is a multiplatform remake of my first Android app: 
"Orbitals LWP & Daydream" (2014).

This project is primarily a playground for understanding Kotlin Multiplatform and Jetbrains'
multiplatform version of Compose.

- Shared physics engine.
- Settings UI implemented in Compose and shared between all target platforms.
- Can be used as a live wallpaper or screensaver on Android.
- Supports localisation via Jetpack Compose resources
